This was a worry for me initially - I loved this artists work, but had no idea how my idea would work because the idea was very vague. I suggested something about The Little Prince and The Fox. Because they were very busy at the time I made the trip without seeing anything until the day of the tattoo itself. I also had to work until the day before the tattoo, so ended up getting a very late flight to Lisbon from London, and because of hostel finding difficulties, ended up only getting a few hours of sleep before I had to get up and be there to get the tattoo. (This was the first one I actually fell asleep during, and they were a little surprised I was able to.)
