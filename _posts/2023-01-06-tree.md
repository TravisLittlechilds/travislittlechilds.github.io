This was my first Tattoo, by an artist called [Noon](https://www.instagram.com/noonkamikaz/), and was also the first transatlantic trip for a specific artist. I was living in Saskatoon temporarily after moving back after 3 years in London, and had to travel back to London to have it done. It was an 11 month wait from requesting a spot until I was able to have a booking.

This tattoo was done at [The Family Business Tattoo](https://www.thefamilybusinesstattoo.com/) in London, UK.
