This one is actually one that was slightly unusual for me -- usually I pick an artist I really like, make a booking, and figure out a design months in advance. This time I did some of that. I liked the artist, since I'd been to them before. I did make the booking months in advance -- but I had no idea what I wanted really. Near the date, I'd had a few ideas that I was told wouldn't work in the artist's style, and eventually they suggested some of the things they had drawn but no one had picked. Usually I'm not a fan of just picking something from their book, but in this case, I found this near the end and instantly loved it. 

The artist for this was [Taylor Catclaw](https://www.instagram.com/taylorcatclaw/) in a different location than last time since now they have their own place [Brightside Tattoo Collective](https://www.instagram.com/brightsidetattoocollective/)
