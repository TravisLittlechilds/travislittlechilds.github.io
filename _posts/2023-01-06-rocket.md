This was my second tattoo, and although less of a long adventure than my first, it was fun, and much nicer. I'd found this artist through an instagram post that was actually a collaboration between her and Taylor Catclaw, who has done two of my other pieces. I had to book this one about 6 months in advance, but had the idea and everything ready from the day I booked. At the time she was based out of a studio in Lisbon, and I made the trip on a shoestring budget so stayed in what I think is the cheapest hostel I've ever stayed at -- and definitely the cheapest I'd want to stay at if I had a choice. 

Artist: [Nouvelle Rita](https://www.instagram.com/nouvellerita/) at the time working out of [Big Boys Tattoo](https://www.instagram.com/bigboystattoo.pt/), now working in ... London! (She's another artist I've considered for a second piece multiple times.)
