My most recent, a tie for the furthest travel - and actually the same trip, but in reverse. After living in London for almost 10 years, I found another artist I really liked who worked out of a private studio based in Saskatoon, strangely. So in December of 2022, I made the trip from London to Saskatoon to get this work done. 

Reading was always important in my life, and Frog and Toad Together was the first book I read. I remember growing up that I always thought I was like Frog, since Toad is a little neurotic, worries too much, and procrastinates for no real reason. He's a bit of a disaster. A very well meaning and good hearted disaster, but still, a bit of a disaster. Now that I'm an adult... I realise I'm nothing like Frog at all, and I've been Toad all along. 

Artist: [Chantel Gaurand - mousetattoos](https://www.instagram.com/mousetattoos/) a studio based in Sasaktoon.
